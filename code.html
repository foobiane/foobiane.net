            <h2>PedalJUCE</h2>
            <p><i>Date:</i> May 2025 - Ongoing</p>
            <p><i>Description:</i> PedalJUCE is a JUCE-powered digital guitar pedal emulator VST and standalone application. The goal of this project is to provide users with a free library of common guitar pedal effects that can be used in live performance scenarios.</p>
            <p><i>Desired features:</i></p>
            <ul>
              <li>GUI workspace for connecting and modifying pedals, including their parameters (e.g., tone knobs)</li>
              <li>Diverse collection of pedal modules, including classic guitar effects pedals (e.g., distortion, tremolo) and new effects made possible via DSP (e.g., convolution)</li>
              <li>Preset system for both pedals and pedal arrangements</li>
              <li>Control via external devices and a context selection system (e.g., MIDI knobs control a selected pedal knob)</li>
              <li>Simple stereo IO system that hooks into and interacts with system IO</li>
              <li>Low latency processing</li>
              <li>Support for deployment into a Raspberry Pi system for live performance use</li>
              <li>Application for constructing and generating GUI code for pedals graphically</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>converb~</h2>
            <p><i>Date:</i> February - May 2025</p>
            <p><i>Description:</i> converb~ is an unpartitioned convolution reverb external for Pure Data coded in C. This project was created as part of my capstone presentation for my undergrad at UIUC.</p>
            <p><i>Features:</i></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Convolves input signals with a fixed-length impulse response (read using tabread~)</li>
              <li>Uses windowing to minimize clicks created from convolution</li>
              <li>Uses estimated FFTs from the FFTW3 library to efficiently perform convolution in pseudo real time</li>
              <li>Detailed help file (converb~-help.pd) that explains how to use converb~</li>
            </ul>
            <p><i>Areas for improvement:</i></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Use partitioning to reduce IR delay</li>
              <li>Use a more sophisticated vector multiplication algorithm to speed up the convolution step. This could consist of SIMD and/or alignment tricks in C</li>
              <li>Investigate if FFTW plans can be saved and reused in the object proper</li>
            </ul>
