        <h2>who are you?</h2>
        <p>my name is ian doherty, and my work mostly concerns the intersections of computers, audio, and music. i'm particularly interested in musical systems (e.g., daws, plugins), dsp related stuff, and coding all of the above.</p>
        <p>i am a class of 2025 graduate of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign's <a href="https://siebelschool.illinois.edu/academics/undergraduate/degree-program-options/cs-x-degree-programs/computer-science-music">B.S. in Computer Science + Music program</a>. there, i studied under <a href="https://www.kerrylhagan.net/">Dr. Kerry Hagan</a>, <a href="https://paris.cs.illinois.edu/">Dr. Paris Smaragdis</a>, and <a href="http://www.elifieldsteel.com/">Dr. Eli Fieldsteel</a>. my program taught us about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_Data">Pure Data</a>, dsp, and electroacoustic composition in the context of a robust computer science program. so most of my skills involve working with these things through code.</p>
        <p>in August 2025, i plan to begin my studies for McGill University's <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/music/programs/ma-music-technology/program-overview">M.A. in Music Technology</a> program in Montreal, Canada.</p>
        <p>i also do a lot of music production and performance in my spare time. i have produced hip hop beats under the name IDES, recorded and engineered my friends' bands, and performed rock/folk music as myself and my band, spingo.</p>
        
        <h2>what have you done?!</h2>
        <p>heinous things. truly.</p>

          <li><i>January 2025 to May 2025:</i> <a href="code.html">converb~</a>, an unpartitioned convolution reverb external for Pure Data. Senior capstone project at UIUC.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>my resume is <a href="">here</a>, if you wanna look at it.</p>
        
        <h2>what can you do for me?</h2>

          <li>patch & external development for Pure Data</li>
          <li>daw plugin development using JUCE</li>
        </ul>
        <p><i>PLEASE NOTE</i> that all services are subject to my own availability. i'm still a full time student-- i will need time to complete my studies.</p>
        <p>that being said, if i have enough time for your project, i will clearly communicate with you what my availability looks like and when to expect a final product.</p>
        
        <h2>how do i get in touch?</h2>
        <p>my preferred mode of communication is via email. my email address is <a href="mailto:dohertyiane@outlook.com">dohertyiane@outlook.com</a>. you can also contact me through my social media (see below).</p>
      
        <h2>why does this website look like trash bro</h2>
        <p>it's campy, i like the web 1.0 aesthetic, and it's a tradition that my own cs classes have followed <a href="https://courses.grainger.illinois.edu/cs374al1/sp2024/">☺</a></p>
